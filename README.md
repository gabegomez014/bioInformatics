# bioInformatics
A repo to hold all my bioinformatic related projects. All programs were inspired from the Rosalind Team, and any other
problem contributors.

For these projects, you will need, at least, gcc/C++ compiler version 4.2.1 (comes with Xcode if on a mac),  Java version 1.8.0_102, and Python 3.5.2

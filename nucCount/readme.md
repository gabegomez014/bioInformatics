Context for the problem:

Cells are the building blocks of life. All living things are made up of cells. Within cells lies
the nucleus, and within those are chromatin.

One class of macromolecules found in chromatin are nucleic acids. The nucleic acid
monomer is called a nucleotide, and every nucleotide has a nucleobase compound.

Nucleotide is used as a unit of strand length and is abbreviated nt.

The only four option for nucleobase molecules are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G),
and Thymine (T).

Problem: Given, a DNA string "dna", where dna <= (1000 nucleobase molecules), return
four integers in a list, where each index represents "A", "C", "G", and "T", in that order.

Solutions:
- C: Incomplete
- C++: Incomplete
- Java: Incomplete
- Python: Incomplete

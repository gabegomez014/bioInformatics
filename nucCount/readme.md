Inspiration:

	Cells are the building blocks of life. All living things are made up of cells. Within cells lies
	the nucleus, and within those are chromatin.

	One class of macromolecules found in chromatin are nucleic acids. The nucleic acid
	monomer is called a nucleotide, and every nucleotide has a nucleobase compound.

	Nucleotide is used as a unit of strand length and is abbreviated nt.

	The only four option for nucleobase molecules are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G),
	and Thymine (T).

Problem: 

	Given, a DNA string "dna", where dna <= (1000 nucleobase molecules), return
	four integers in a list (or with spaces between them), where each index represents "A", "C", "G", and "T", in that order.

Solutions:

	- C: Complete
	- C++: Complete
	- Java: Complete
	- Python: Incomplete

How to run:

	In order to run any of the files, you first need to compile them. I have provided a make file that will do this for you 
	so long as you have the compilers in your system for the language in question. 

	Choose the file you'd like to see run and in your terminal write "make nucCountX", where "X" is the language being compiled.

	"X" can be any of the following forms:
	- C: X = C
	- C++: X = Cpp
	- Java: X = Java

	*Note: For C, you have to make the ".o" file first. To do this, simply type "make nucCountC.o"
	*Note: For Python files, simply type "python3 nucleotideCounter.py"

Clean:

	To remove files .o files and executables, simply type "make clean". This will not delete the code files

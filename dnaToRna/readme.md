Inspiration:

	There is a second nucleic acid that exists from our good old "A" "C" "G" "T" nucleic acids. The one we are describing
	here is called uracil ("U"), and it is a replacement for thymine ("T").

	Uracil possesses a different sugar called ribose, which is how we get Ribose Nucleic Acid (RNA). 

	In eukaryotes, DNA remains in the nucleus while RNA can travel anywhere within a cell in order to deliver DNA instructions.
	In future problems, we will dive more into RNA. 

Problem: 

	Given, a DNA string "dna", where dna <= (1000 nucleobase molecules), 
	Return the transcribed RNA string of "dna"
	

Solutions:

	- C: Complete
	- C++: Incomplete
	- Java: Complete
	- Python: Incomplete

How to run:

	In order to run any of the files, you first need to compile them. I have provided a make file that will do this for you 
	so long as you have the compilers in your system for the language in question. 

	Choose the file you'd like to see run and in your terminal write "make nucCountX", where "X" is the language being compiled.

	"X" can be any of the following forms:
	- C: X = C
	- C++: X = Cpp
	- Java: X = Java

	*Note: For C, you have to make the ".o" file first. To do this, simply type "make nucCountC.o"
	*Note: For Python files, simply type "python3 nucleotideCounter.py"

Clean:

	To remove files, .o files and executables, simply type "make clean". This will not delete the code files
